<h1>All About Me!!</h1>
<h3>About Cassius Klier</h3>
<p>My name is Cassius, but a lot of my friends call me Cash. I am a 17 year old living in a small neighborhood. I was born and raised in Washington Heights with my Mom, Dad, and Brother 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦. But once my parents got promoted in their jobs, we decieded to move out to Woodlawn in the Bronx.</p>        
<p>I take the 2 train at 233rd st but I will start taking metro north again once my school metro card is reinstated. I go to LaGuardia High school in Manhattan and major in technical theater(tech). Ive met a lot of new people and learned a lot from working in tech, and my classes.💯</p>
<p>Photography is my main passion📸, as Ive been documenting my life. I've created 3 books and started going to a New York City Salt recidencey program for Photography. I've als applied myself to a couple other jobs/internships such as the tech photography role at school and a job at the Bronx Art Mueseum, so <em>wish me luck!!</em><p>
<p>This last summer I spent my time at a summer camp🌲, working the entire summer as a councilor. In which I experienced nature, meaningful connections, growth and change, hardships, and working for myself. It was a great experience and I was rewarded councilor of the summer for day camp. Me and my friends are planning to go back next year.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading!!😄😄</strong></p>
